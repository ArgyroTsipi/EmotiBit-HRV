# EmotiBit-HRV

Our project focuses on the correlation between changes in Heart Rate Variability and emotional well-being. We used EmotiBit to record HRV while doing different activities. After analysing the signals using Python, we detected changes in the HRV value. We leveraged Figma in order to design a prototype of an application that measures live the HRV value, records and stores HRV changes, so that the users can add the activities they were doing during these times. The point of the app is to raise users' awareness about the effect HRV might have in their well-being and how different activities influence their HRV.
